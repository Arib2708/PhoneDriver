# Phone Driver

A Python-based mobile automation agent that uses Qwen3-VL vision-language models to understand and interact with Android devices through visual analysis and ADB commands.

## Features

- ü§ñ **Vision-powered automation**: Uses Qwen3-VL to visually understand phone screens
- üì± **ADB integration**: Controls Android devices via ADB commands
- üéØ **Natural language tasks**: Describe what you want in plain English
- üñ•Ô∏è **Web UI**: Built-in Gradio interface for easy control
- üìä **Real-time feedback**: Live screenshots and execution logs

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Android device with USB debugging & Developer Mode enabled
- ADB (Android Debug Bridge) installed
- GPU with sufficient VRAM (Tested on 128gb Strix Halo with Qwen3-VL-30B Model) 

## Installation

### 1. Install ADB

**Linux/Ubuntu:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install adb
```
### 2. Clone Repo & Install Python Dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OminousIndustries/PhoneDriver.git
cd PhoneDriver
```
Create a Virtual Enviornment

```bash
python -m venv phonedriver
source phonedriver/bin/activate
```
Install Python Deps

```bash
# Install transformers from source for latest Qwen3-VL support
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers

# Install other requirements
pip install pillow gradio qwen_vl_utils requests
```

### 3. Connect Your Device

1. Enable USB debugging on your Android device (Settings ‚Üí Developer Options)
2. Connect via USB
3. Verify connection:
```bash
adb devices
```
You should see your device listed.

## Configuration

### Model Selection

Edit `qwen_vl_agent.py` to choose your model:

```python
# For 30B model
model_name: str = "Qwen/Qwen3-VL-30B-A3B-Instruct"

# For 8B model 
# Uncomment this line and comment out the 30B line above:
#model_name: str = "Qwen/Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct"
```

### Screen Resolution

The agent can auto-detect your device resolution from the Web UI settings tab, but you can manually configure it in `config.json`.

```json
{
  "screen_width": 1080,
  "screen_height": 2340,
  ...
}
```

To get your device resolution, with the device connected to your computer type the following in the terminal: 
```bash
adb shell wm size
```

## Usage

### Web UI (Recommended)

Launch the Gradio interface:

```bash
python ui.py
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:7860` and enter tasks like:
- "Open Chrome"
- "Search for weather in New York"
- "Open Settings and enable WiFi"

### Command Line

```bash
python phone_agent.py "your task here"
```

Example:
```bash
python phone_agent.py "Open the camera app"
```

## How It Works

1. **Screenshot Capture**: Takes a screenshot of the phone via ADB
2. **Visual Analysis**: Qwen3-VL analyzes the screen to understand UI elements
3. **Action Planning**: Determines the best action to take (tap, swipe, type, etc.)
4. **Execution**: Sends ADB commands to perform the action
5. **Repeat**: Continues until task is complete or max cycles reached

## Configuration Options

Key settings in `config.json`:

- `temperature`: Model creativity (0.0-1.0, default: 0.1)
- `max_tokens`: Max response length (default: 512)
- `step_delay`: Wait time between actions in seconds (default: 1.5)
- `max_retries`: Maximum retry attempts (default: 3)
- `use_flash_attention`: Enable Flash Attention 2 for faster inference

## Troubleshooting

**Device not detected:**
- Ensure USB debugging is enabled
- Run `adb devices` to verify connection
- Try `adb kill-server && adb start-server`

**Wrong tap locations:**
- Auto-detect resolution in Settings tab of UI
- Or manually verify with `adb shell wm size`

**Model loading errors:**
- Ensure you have sufficient VRAM
- Try the 8B model for lower memory requirements
- Check that transformers is installed from source

**Out of memory:**
- Use the 8B model instead of 30B
- Reduce `max_tokens` in config
- Close other applications using GPU memory
